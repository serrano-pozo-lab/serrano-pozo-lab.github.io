										<h2 class="major">Alberto Serrano-Pozo, MD, PhD</h2>
										<p>Dr. Serrano-Pozo is an Assistant Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and a staff neurologist at the Memory Division of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Neurology Department. He received his MD at the University of Málaga and his PhD at the University of Seville in Spain. He completed Neurology residencies at University of Seville and University of Iowa, the latter followed by a fellowship in clinical dementias at MGH.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Celia R. Bianco, BS</h3>
											<p>Celia received her B.S. in Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology from Emory University. Her undergraduate research focused on the immune response in the spinal cord following peripheral nerve injuries. She joined the lab in 2024 as a research technician to investigate how well blood-based biomarkers reflect underlying postmortem neuropathology across Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Neus Rabaneda-Lombarte, MD PhD</h3>
											<p>Neus graduated in Biomedicine from the Universitat de Barcelona in Spain and earned a Master's degree in Neurosciences, followed by a PhD in Biomedicine and an M.D. degree at the same institution. She then completed her Neurology residency at the Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol in Badalona (Spain). She joined the lab in 2024 as a postdoctoral research fellow to study the role of reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Clara Muñoz-Castro, PhD</h3>
											<p>Clara obtained her PhD from University of Seville (Spain), where she investigated the role of astrocytes and microglia in Alzheimer's disease. She joined the lab as a postdoc in 2021 to investigate the role of GFAP upregulation by reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease mouse models. She earned the Real Colegio Complutense at Harvard University postdoctoral research fellowship. After her postdoc in our lab, she moved back to University of Seville as Adjunct Assistant Professor.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Methasit Jaisa-aad, MD</h3>
											<p>Methasit received his MD from Srinakarinwirot University in Thailand and was a Research Associate at Mahidol University also in Thailand. He was the recipient of the prestigious Prince Mahidol Award Youth Program (PMAYP) Scholarship and joined the lab in 2022 to investigate the monoamine oxidase-B as a marker of reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. After his postdoc, he moved to West Virginia University to start his US Neurology residency.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Molly A. Healey, BA</h3>
											<p>Molly obtained her B.A. in Neuroscience from Hamilton College in New York, where her research focused on adenosine-mediated neuroprotection during anoxia in freshwater turtles. She joined the lab as a research technician in 2022 to study the role of GFAP upregulation in Alzheimer's disease reactive astrocytes. After two wonderful years with us, she moved to the University of Pennsylvania to obtain her PhD in Neuroscience.</p>
