METHODS We performed laser capture microdissection of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, the 50 μm halo around them, tangles with the 50 μm halo around them, and areas distant ({\textgreater} 50 μm) from plaques and tangles in the temporal cortex of AD and control donors, followed by RNA-sequencing. RESULTS Aβ plaques exhibited upregulated microglial (neuroinflammation/phagocytosis) and downregulated neuronal (neurotransmission/energy metabolism) genes, whereas tangles had mostly downregulated neuronal genes. Aβ plaques had more differentially expressed genes than tangles. We identified a gradient Aβ plaque {\textgreater} peri-plaque {\textgreater} tangle {\textgreater} distant for these changes. AD APOE ε4 homozygotes had greater changes than APOE ε3 across locations, especially within Aβ plaques. DISCUSSION Transcriptomic changes in AD consist primarily of neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction, are spatially associated mainly with Aβ plaques, and are exacerbated by the APOE ε4 allele.},

			All human beings undergo a lifelong cumulative exposure to potentially preventable adverse factors such as toxins, infections, traumatisms, and cardiovascular risk factors, collectively termed exposome. The interplay between the individual's genetics and exposome is thought to have a large impact in health outcomes such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Likewise, a growing body of evidence is supporting the idea that preventable factors explain a sizable proportion of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) cases.
			Recent findings 
			Here, we will review the most recent epidemiological, experimental preclinical, and interventional clinical studies examining some of these potentially modifiable risk factors for ADRD. We will focus on new evidence regarding cardiovascular risk factors, air pollution, viral and other infectious agents, traumatic brain injury, and hearing loss.
			Summary 
			While greater and higher quality epidemiological and experimental evidence is needed to unequivocally confirm their causal link with ADRD and/or unravel the underlying mechanisms, these modifiable risk factors may represent a window of opportunity to reduce ADRD incidence and prevalence at the population level via health screenings, and education and health policies.},

	abstract = {Reactive astrogliosis accompanies the two neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD)—Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles—and parallels neurodegeneration in AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Thus, there is growing interest in developing imaging and fluid biomarkers of reactive astrogliosis for AD/ADRD diagnosis and prognostication. Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) is emerging as a target for PET imaging radiotracers of reactive astrogliosis. However, a thorough characterization of MAO-B expression in postmortem control and AD/ADRD brains is lacking. We sought to: (1) identify the primary cell type(s) expressing MAO-B in control and AD brains; (2) quantify MAO-B immunoreactivity in multiple brain regions of control and AD donors as a proxy for PET radiotracer uptake; (3) correlate MAO-B level with local AD neuropathological changes, reactive glia, and cortical atrophy; (4) determine whether the MAOB rs1799836 SNP genotype impacts MAO-B expression level; (5) compare MAO-B immunoreactivity across AD/ADRD, including Lewy body diseases (LBD) and frontotemporal lobar degenerations with tau (FTLD-Tau) and TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). We found that MAO-B is mainly expressed by subpial and perivascular cortical astrocytes as well as by fibrous white matter astrocytes in control brains, whereas in AD brains, MAO-B is significantly upregulated by both cortical reactive astrocytes and white matter astrocytes across temporal, frontal, and occipital lobes. By contrast, MAO-B expression level was unchanged and lowest in cerebellum. Cortical MAO-B expression was independently associated with cortical atrophy and local measures of reactive astrocytes and microglia, and significantly increased in reactive astrocytes surrounding Thioflavin-S+ dense-core Aβ plaques. MAO-B expression was not affected by the MAOB rs1799836 SNP genotype. MAO-B expression was also significantly increased in the frontal cortex and white matter of donors with corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, and FTLD-TDP, but not in LBD or progressive supranuclear palsy. These findings support ongoing efforts to develop MAO-B-based PET radiotracers to image reactive astrogliosis in AD/ADRD.},

	abstract = {For the past three decades, apolipoprotein E (APOE) has been known as the single greatest genetic modulator of sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) risk, influencing both the average age of onset and the lifetime risk of developing AD. The APOEε4 allele significantly increases AD risk, whereas the ε2 allele is protective relative to the most common ε3 allele. However, large differences in effect size exist across ethnoracial groups that are likely to depend on both global genetic ancestry and local genetic ancestry, as well as gene–environment interactions. Although early studies linked APOE to amyloid-β — one of the two culprit aggregation-prone proteins that define AD — in the past decade, mounting work has associated APOE with other neurodegenerative proteinopathies and broader ageing-related brain changes, such as neuroinflammation, energy metabolism failure, loss of myelin integrity and increased blood–brain barrier permeability, with potential implications for longevity and resilience to pathological protein aggregates. Novel mouse models and other technological advances have also enabled a number of therapeutic approaches aimed at either attenuating the APOEε4-linked increased AD risk or enhancing the APOEε2-linked AD protection. This Review summarizes this progress and highlights areas for future research towards the development of APOE-directed therapeutics.},

Reactive astrocytes can be observed in the vicinity of plaques and tangles, and the relationship between astrocytes and these AD neuropathological lesions is bidirectional so that each AD neuropathological hallmark causes specific changes in astrocytes, and astrocytes modulate the severity of each neuropathological feature in a specific manner. Here, we will review both how astrocytes change as a result of their chronic exposure to AD neuropathology and how those astrocytic changes impact each AD neuropathological feature. We will emphasize the repercussions that AD-associated reactive astrogliosis has for the astrocyte–neuron interaction and highlight areas of uncertainty and priorities for future research.},

Here we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of 628,943 astrocytes from five brain regions representing the stereotypical progression of AD pathology across 32 donors spanning the entire normal aging to severe AD continuum. We mapped out several unique astrocyte subclusters that exhibited varying responses to neuropathology across the AD-vulnerable neural network (spatial axis) or AD pathology stage (temporal axis). The proportion of homeostatic, intermediate and reactive astrocytes changed only along the spatial axis, whereas two other subclusters changed along the temporal axis. One of these, a trophic factor-rich subcluster, declined along pathology stages, whereas the other increased in the late stage but returned to baseline levels in the end stage, suggesting an exhausted response with chronic exposure to neuropathology. Our study underscores the complex dynamics of astrocytic responses in AD.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives We previously found that the APOE genotype affects the rate of cognitive decline in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia independently of its effects on AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and copathologies. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the APOE alleles differentially affect the rate of cognitive decline at the normal aging-early AD continuum and that this association is independent of their effects on classical ADNC and copathologies.
Methods We analyzed APOE associations with the cognitive trajectories (Clinical Dementia Rating scale Sum of Boxes [CDR-SOB] and Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) of more than 1,000 individuals from a national clinicopathologic sample who had either no, mild (sparse neuritic plaques and the Braak neurofibrillary tangle [NFT] stage I/II), or intermediate (moderate neuritic plaques and the Braak NFT stage III/IV) ADNC levels at autopsy via 2 latent classes reverse-time longitudinal modeling.
Results Carrying the APOEε4 allele was associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline by both CDR-SOB and MMSE relative to APOEε3 homozygotes. This association remained statistically significant after adjusting for ADNC severity, comorbid pathologies, and the effects of ADNC on the slope of cognitive decline. Our modeling strategy identified 2 latent classes in which APOEε4 carriers declined faster than APOEε3 homozygotes, with latent class 1 members representing slow decliners (CDR-SOB: 76.7\% of individuals, 0.195 vs 0.146 points/y in APOEε4 vs APOEε3/ε3; MMSE: 88.6\% of individuals, −0.303 vs −0.153 points/y in APOEε4 vs APOEε3/ε3), whereas latent class 2 members were fast decliners (CDR-SOB: 23.3\% of participants, 1.536 vs 1.487 points/y in APOEε4 vs APOEε3/ε3; MMSE: 11.4\% of participants, −2.538 vs −2.387 points/y in APOEε4 vs APOEε3/ε3). Compared with slow decliners, fast decliners were more likely to carry the APOEε4 allele, younger at initial visit and death, more impaired at initial and last visits, and more likely to have intermediate (vs none or mild) ADNC levels, as well as concurrent Lewy bodies and hippocampal sclerosis at autopsy.
Discussion In a large national sample selected to represent the normal aging-early AD continuum, the APOEε4 allele is associated with a modest but statistically significant acceleration of the cognitive decline rate even after controlling for its effects on ADNC and comorbid pathologies.},

	abstract = {Aims Reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have traditionally been demonstrated by increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity; however, astrocyte reaction is a complex and heterogeneous phenomenon involving multiple astrocyte functions beyond cytoskeletal remodelling. To better understand astrocyte reaction in AD, we conducted a systematic review of astrocyte immunohistochemical studies in post-mortem AD brains followed by bioinformatics analyses on the extracted reactive astrocyte markers. Methods NCBI PubMed, APA PsycInfo and WoS-SCIE databases were interrogated for original English research articles with the search terms ‘Alzheimer's disease’ AND ‘astrocytes.’ Bioinformatics analyses included protein–protein interaction network analysis, pathway enrichment, and transcription factor enrichment, as well as comparison with public human -omics datasets. Results A total of 306 articles meeting eligibility criteria rendered 196 proteins, most of which were reported to be upregulated in AD vs control brains. Besides cytoskeletal remodelling (e.g., GFAP), bioinformatics analyses revealed a wide range of functional alterations including neuroinflammation (e.g., IL6, MAPK1/3/8 and TNF), oxidative stress and antioxidant defence (e.g., MT1A/2A, NFE2L2, NOS1/2/3, PRDX6 and SOD1/2), lipid metabolism (e.g., APOE, CLU and LRP1), proteostasis (e.g., cathepsins, CRYAB and HSPB1/2/6/8), extracellular matrix organisation (e.g., CD44, MMP1/3 and SERPINA3), and neurotransmission (e.g., CHRNA7, GABA, GLUL, GRM5, MAOB and SLC1A2), among others. CTCF and ESR1 emerged as potential transcription factors driving these changes. Comparison with published -omics datasets validated our results, demonstrating a significant overlap with reported transcriptomic and proteomic changes in AD brains and/or CSF.

These findings remained largely unchanged after controlling  for the effect of AD neuropathologic changes on the rate of cognitive decline and  for the presence and severity of comorbid pathologies. CONCLUSION: Compared to the  APOE ε3/ε3 reference genotype, the APOE ε2 and ε4 alleles have opposite (slowing and  accelerating, respectively) effects on the rate of cognitive decline, which are  clinically relevant and largely independent of the differential APOE allele effects  on AD and comorbid pathologies. Thus, APOE genotype contributes to the heterogeneity  in rate of clinical progression in AD.},

Although this remodeling was first described over a century ago, uncertainties and  controversies remain regarding the contribution of reactive astrocytes to CNS  diseases, repair, and aging. It is also unclear whether fixed categories of reactive  astrocytes exist and, if so, how to identify them. We point out the shortcomings of  binary divisions of reactive astrocytes into good-vs-bad,  neurotoxic-vs-neuroprotective or A1-vs-A2. We advocate, instead, that research on  reactive astrocytes include assessment of multiple molecular and functional  parameters-preferably in vivo-plus multivariate statistics and determination of  impact on pathological hallmarks in relevant models. These guidelines may spur the  discovery of astrocyte-based biomarkers as well as astrocyte-targeting therapies  that abrogate detrimental actions of reactive astrocytes, potentiate their neuro-  and glioprotective actions, and restore or augment their homeostatic, modulatory,  and defensive functions.},

	abstract = {Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body diseases (LBD), and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD)  spectrum are defined by the accumulation of specific misfolded protein aggregates.  However, the mechanisms by which each proteinopathy leads to neurodegeneration  remain elusive. We hypothesized that there is a common "pan-neurodegenerative" gene  expression signature driving pathophysiology across these clinically and  pathologically diverse proteinopathies. To test this hypothesis, we performed a  systematic review of human CNS transcriptomics datasets from AD, LBD, and ALS-FTD  patients and age-matched controls in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and  ArrayExpress databases, followed by consistent processing of each dataset,  meta-analysis, pathway enrichment, and overlap analyses. After applying  pre-specified eligibility criteria and stringent data pre-processing, a total of  2600 samples from 26 AD, 21 LBD, and 13 ALS-FTD datasets were included in the  meta-analysis. The pan-neurodegenerative gene signature is characterized by an  upregulation of innate immunity, cytoskeleton, and transcription and RNA processing  genes, and a downregulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Pathway  enrichment analyses also revealed the upregulation of neuroinflammation (including  Toll-like receptor, TNF, and NFκB signaling) and phagocytosis, and the  downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, lysosomal acidification,  and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Our findings suggest that neuroinflammation and a  failure in both neuronal energy metabolism and protein degradation systems are  consistent features underlying neurodegenerative diseases, despite differences in  the extent of neuronal loss and brain regions involved.},

However, no therapies directed at APOE are currently  available. Although initial studies causally linked APOE with amyloid-β peptide  aggregation and clearance, over the past 5 years our understanding of APOE  pathogenesis has expanded beyond amyloid-β peptide-centric mechanisms to tau  neurofibrillary degeneration, microglia and astrocyte responses, and blood-brain  barrier disruption. Because all these pathological processes can potentially  contribute to cognitive impairment, it is important to use this new knowledge to  develop therapies directed at APOE. Several therapeutic approaches have been  successful in mouse models expressing human APOE alleles, including increasing or  reducing APOE levels, enhancing its lipidation, blocking the interactions between  APOE and amyloid-β peptide, and genetically switching APOE4 to APOE3 or APOE2  isoforms, but translation to human clinical trials has proven challenging.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuronal damage in acute CNS injuries and chronic neurodegenerative diseases is invariably accompanied by an astrocyte reaction in both mice and humans.  However, whether and how the nature of the CNS insult-acute versus  chronic-influences the astrocyte response, and whether astrocyte transcriptomic  changes in these mouse models faithfully recapitulate the astrocyte reaction in  human diseases remains to be elucidated. We hypothesized that astrocytes set off  different transcriptomic programs in response to acute versus chronic insults,  besides a shared "pan-injury" signature common to both types of conditions, and  investigated the presence of these mouse astrocyte signatures in transcriptomic  studies from human neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis  of 15 published astrocyte transcriptomic datasets from mouse models of acute injury  (n = 6) and chronic neurodegeneration (n = 9) and identified pan-injury, acute, and  chronic signatures, with both upregulated (UP) and downregulated (DOWN) genes. Next,  we investigated these signatures in 7 transcriptomic datasets from various human  neurodegenerative diseases. RESULTS: In mouse models, the number of UP/DOWN genes  per signature was 64/21 for pan-injury and 109/79 for acute injury, whereas only  13/27 for chronic neurodegeneration. The pan-injury-UP signature was represented by  the classic cytoskeletal hallmarks of astrocyte reaction (Gfap and Vim), plus  extracellular matrix (i.e., Cd44, Lgals1, Lgals3, Timp1), and immune response (i.e.,  C3, Serping1, Fas, Stat1, Stat2, Stat3). The acute injury-UP signature was enriched  in protein synthesis and degradation (both ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy  systems), intracellular trafficking, and anti-oxidant defense genes, whereas the  acute injury-DOWN signature included genes that regulate chromatin structure and  transcriptional activity, many of which are transcriptional repressors. The chronic  neurodegeneration-UP signature was further enriched in astrocyte-secreted  extracellular matrix proteins (Lama4, Cyr61, Thbs4), while the DOWN signature  included relevant genes such as Agl (glycogenolysis), S1pr1 (immune modulation), and  Sod2 (anti-oxidant). Only the pan-injury-UP mouse signature was clearly present in  some human neurodegenerative transcriptomic datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Acute and chronic  CNS injuries lead to distinct astrocyte gene expression programs beyond their common  astrocyte reaction signature. However, caution should be taken when extrapolating  astrocyte transcriptomic findings from mouse models to human diseases.},

We aimed at characterizing the TSPO expression in human  control (CTRL) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Specifically, we sought to: (1)  define the cell type(s) expressing TSPO; (2) compare tspo mRNA and TSPO levels  between AD and CTRL brains; (3) correlate TSPO levels with quantitative  neuropathological measures of reactive glia and AD neuropathological changes; and  (4) investigate the effects of the TSPO rs6971 SNP on tspo mRNA and TSPO levels,  glial responses and AD neuropathological changes. We performed quantitative  immunohistochemistry and Western blot in post-mortem brain samples from CTRL and AD  subjects, as well as analysis of publicly available mouse and human brain RNA-Seq  datasets. We found that: (1) TSPO is expressed not just in microglia, but also in  astrocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells; (2) there is  substantial overlap of tspo mRNA and TSPO levels between AD and CTRL subjects and in  TSPO levels between temporal neocortex and white matter in both groups; (3) TSPO  cortical burden does not correlate with the burden of activated microglia or  reactive astrocytes, Aβ plaques or neurofibrillary tangles, or the cortical  thickness; (4) the TSPO rs6971 SNP does not significantly impact tspo mRNA or TSPO  levels, the magnitude of glial responses, the cortical thickness, or the burden of  AD neuropathological changes. These results could inform ongoing efforts toward the  development of reactive glia-specific PET radioligands.},

While these could be just two frequent unrelated comorbidities  in the elderly, epidemiological research has reinforced the idea that mid-life (age  {\textless}65 years) vascular risk factors increase the risk of late-onset (age ≥ 65 years)  dementia, and specifically AD. By contrast, healthy lifestyle choices such as  leisure activities, physical exercise, and Mediterranean diet are considered  protective against AD. Remarkably, several large population-based longitudinal  epidemiological studies have recently indicated that the incidence and prevalence of  dementia might be decreasing in Western countries. Although it remains unclear  whether these positive trends are attributable to neuropathologically definite AD  versus CVID, based on these epidemiological data it has been estimated that a  sizable proportion of AD cases could be preventable. In this review, we discuss the  current evidence about modifiable risk factors for AD derived from epidemiological,  preclinical, and interventional studies, and analyze the opportunities for  therapeutic and preventative interventions.},

	abstract = {Reactive astrocytes were identified as a component of senile amyloid plaques in the cortex of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients several decades ago. However, their role  in AD pathophysiology has remained elusive ever since, in part owing to the  extrapolation of the literature from primary astrocyte cultures and acute brain  injury models to a chronic neurodegenerative scenario. Recent accumulating evidence  supports the idea that reactive astrocytes in AD acquire neurotoxic properties,  likely due to both a gain of toxic function and a loss of their neurotrophic  effects. However, the diversity and complexity of this glial cell is only beginning  to be unveiled, anticipating that astrocyte reaction might be heterogeneous as well.  Herein we review the evidence from mouse models of AD and human neuropathological  studies and attempt to decipher the main conundrums that astrocytes pose to our  understanding of AD development and progression. We discuss the morphological  features that characterize astrocyte reaction in the AD brain, the consequences of  astrocyte reaction for both astrocyte biology and AD pathological hallmarks, and the  molecular pathways that have been implicated in this reaction.},
