	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the APOE genotype is a significant driver of heterogeneity in Alzheimer disease (AD) clinical progression, which could have  important implications for clinical trial design and interpretation. METHODS: We  applied novel reverse-time longitudinal models to analyze the trajectories of  Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) and Mini-Mental State Examination  (MMSE) scores-2 common outcome measures in AD clinical trials-in 1,102  autopsy-proven AD cases (moderate/frequent neuritic plaques and Braak tangle stage  III or greater) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Neuropathology  database resembling participants with mild to moderate AD in therapeutic clinical  trials. RESULTS: APOE ε4 carriers exhibited ≈1.5 times faster CDR-SOB increase than  APOE ε3/ε3 carriers (2.12 points per year vs 1.44 points per year) and ≈1.3 times  faster increase than APOE ε2 carriers (1.65 points per year), whereas APOE ε2 vs  APOE ε3/ε3 difference was not statistically significant. APOE ε4 carriers had ≈1.1  times faster MMSE decline than APOE ε3/ε3 carriers (-3.45 vs -3.03 points per year)  and ≈1.4 times faster decline than APOE ε2 carriers (-2.43 points per year), whereas  APOE ε2 carriers had ≈1.2 times slower decline than APOE ε3/ε3 carriers (-2.43 vs  -3.03 points per year). These findings remained largely unchanged after controlling  for the effect of AD neuropathologic changes on the rate of cognitive decline and  for the presence and severity of comorbid pathologies. CONCLUSION: Compared to the  APOE ε3/ε3 reference genotype, the APOE ε2 and ε4 alleles have opposite (slowing and  accelerating, respectively) effects on the rate of cognitive decline, which are  clinically relevant and largely independent of the differential APOE allele effects  on AD and comorbid pathologies. Thus, APOE genotype contributes to the heterogeneity  in rate of clinical progression in AD.},

	abstract = {Reactive astrocytes are astrocytes undergoing morphological, molecular, and functional remodeling in response to injury, disease, or infection of the CNS.  Although this remodeling was first described over a century ago, uncertainties and  controversies remain regarding the contribution of reactive astrocytes to CNS  diseases, repair, and aging. It is also unclear whether fixed categories of reactive  astrocytes exist and, if so, how to identify them. We point out the shortcomings of  binary divisions of reactive astrocytes into good-vs-bad,  neurotoxic-vs-neuroprotective or A1-vs-A2. We advocate, instead, that research on  reactive astrocytes include assessment of multiple molecular and functional  parameters-preferably in vivo-plus multivariate statistics and determination of  impact on pathological hallmarks in relevant models. These guidelines may spur the  discovery of astrocyte-based biomarkers as well as astrocyte-targeting therapies  that abrogate detrimental actions of reactive astrocytes, potentiate their neuro-  and glioprotective actions, and restore or augment their homeostatic, modulatory,  and defensive functions.},

	abstract = {Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body diseases (LBD), and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD)  spectrum are defined by the accumulation of specific misfolded protein aggregates.  However, the mechanisms by which each proteinopathy leads to neurodegeneration  remain elusive. We hypothesized that there is a common "pan-neurodegenerative" gene  expression signature driving pathophysiology across these clinically and  pathologically diverse proteinopathies. To test this hypothesis, we performed a  systematic review of human CNS transcriptomics datasets from AD, LBD, and ALS-FTD  patients and age-matched controls in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and  ArrayExpress databases, followed by consistent processing of each dataset,  meta-analysis, pathway enrichment, and overlap analyses. After applying  pre-specified eligibility criteria and stringent data pre-processing, a total of  2600 samples from 26 AD, 21 LBD, and 13 ALS-FTD datasets were included in the  meta-analysis. The pan-neurodegenerative gene signature is characterized by an  upregulation of innate immunity, cytoskeleton, and transcription and RNA processing  genes, and a downregulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Pathway  enrichment analyses also revealed the upregulation of neuroinflammation (including  Toll-like receptor, TNF, and NFκB signaling) and phagocytosis, and the  downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, lysosomal acidification,  and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Our findings suggest that neuroinflammation and a  failure in both neuronal energy metabolism and protein degradation systems are  consistent features underlying neurodegenerative diseases, despite differences in  the extent of neuronal loss and brain regions involved.},

However, no therapies directed at APOE are currently  available. Although initial studies causally linked APOE with amyloid-β peptide  aggregation and clearance, over the past 5 years our understanding of APOE  pathogenesis has expanded beyond amyloid-β peptide-centric mechanisms to tau  neurofibrillary degeneration, microglia and astrocyte responses, and blood-brain  barrier disruption. Because all these pathological processes can potentially  contribute to cognitive impairment, it is important to use this new knowledge to  develop therapies directed at APOE. Several therapeutic approaches have been  successful in mouse models expressing human APOE alleles, including increasing or  reducing APOE levels, enhancing its lipidation, blocking the interactions between  APOE and amyloid-β peptide, and genetically switching APOE4 to APOE3 or APOE2  isoforms, but translation to human clinical trials has proven challenging.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuronal damage in acute CNS injuries and chronic neurodegenerative diseases is invariably accompanied by an astrocyte reaction in both mice and humans.  However, whether and how the nature of the CNS insult-acute versus  chronic-influences the astrocyte response, and whether astrocyte transcriptomic  changes in these mouse models faithfully recapitulate the astrocyte reaction in  human diseases remains to be elucidated. We hypothesized that astrocytes set off  different transcriptomic programs in response to acute versus chronic insults,  besides a shared "pan-injury" signature common to both types of conditions, and  investigated the presence of these mouse astrocyte signatures in transcriptomic  studies from human neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis  of 15 published astrocyte transcriptomic datasets from mouse models of acute injury  (n = 6) and chronic neurodegeneration (n = 9) and identified pan-injury, acute, and  chronic signatures, with both upregulated (UP) and downregulated (DOWN) genes. Next,  we investigated these signatures in 7 transcriptomic datasets from various human  neurodegenerative diseases. RESULTS: In mouse models, the number of UP/DOWN genes  per signature was 64/21 for pan-injury and 109/79 for acute injury, whereas only  13/27 for chronic neurodegeneration. The pan-injury-UP signature was represented by  the classic cytoskeletal hallmarks of astrocyte reaction (Gfap and Vim), plus  extracellular matrix (i.e., Cd44, Lgals1, Lgals3, Timp1), and immune response (i.e.,  C3, Serping1, Fas, Stat1, Stat2, Stat3). The acute injury-UP signature was enriched  in protein synthesis and degradation (both ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy  systems), intracellular trafficking, and anti-oxidant defense genes, whereas the  acute injury-DOWN signature included genes that regulate chromatin structure and  transcriptional activity, many of which are transcriptional repressors. The chronic  neurodegeneration-UP signature was further enriched in astrocyte-secreted  extracellular matrix proteins (Lama4, Cyr61, Thbs4), while the DOWN signature  included relevant genes such as Agl (glycogenolysis), S1pr1 (immune modulation), and  Sod2 (anti-oxidant). Only the pan-injury-UP mouse signature was clearly present in  some human neurodegenerative transcriptomic datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Acute and chronic  CNS injuries lead to distinct astrocyte gene expression programs beyond their common  astrocyte reaction signature. However, caution should be taken when extrapolating  astrocyte transcriptomic findings from mouse models to human diseases.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes unrelenting, progressive cognitive impairments, but its course is heterogeneous, with a broad range of rates of cognitive decline(1).  The spread of tau aggregates (neurofibrillary tangles) across the cerebral cortex  parallels symptom severity(2,3). We hypothesized that the kinetics of tau spread may  vary if the properties of the propagating tau proteins vary across individuals. We  carried out biochemical, biophysical, MS and both cell- and animal-based-bioactivity  assays to characterize tau in 32 patients with AD. We found striking  patient-to-patient heterogeneity in the hyperphosphorylated species of soluble,  oligomeric, seed-competent tau. Tau seeding activity correlates with the  aggressiveness of the clinical disease, and some post-translational modification  (PTM) sites appear to be associated with both enhanced seeding activity and worse  clinical outcomes, whereas others are not. These data suggest that different  individuals with 'typical' AD may have distinct biochemical features of tau. These  data are consistent with the possibility that individuals with AD, much like people  with cancer, may have multiple molecular drivers of an otherwise common phenotype,  and emphasize the potential for personalized therapeutic approaches for slowing  clinical progression of AD.},

Amyloid beta (Aβ) causes  cytosolic Ca(2+) overload, but the effects of Aβ on mitochondrial Ca(2+) levels in  Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. Using a ratiometric Ca(2+) indicator  targeted to neuronal mitochondria and intravital multiphoton microscopy, we find  increased mitochondrial Ca(2+) levels associated with plaque deposition and neuronal  death in a transgenic mouse model of cerebral β-amyloidosis. Naturally secreted  soluble Aβ applied onto the healthy brain increases Ca(2+) concentration in  mitochondria, which is prevented by blockage of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.  RNA-sequencing from post-mortem AD human brains shows downregulation in the  expression of mitochondrial influx Ca(2+) transporter genes, but upregulation in the  genes related to mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux pathways, suggesting a counteracting  effect to avoid Ca(2+) overload.

We aimed at characterizing the TSPO expression in human  control (CTRL) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Specifically, we sought to: (1)  define the cell type(s) expressing TSPO; (2) compare tspo mRNA and TSPO levels  between AD and CTRL brains; (3) correlate TSPO levels with quantitative  neuropathological measures of reactive glia and AD neuropathological changes; and  (4) investigate the effects of the TSPO rs6971 SNP on tspo mRNA and TSPO levels,  glial responses and AD neuropathological changes. We performed quantitative  immunohistochemistry and Western blot in post-mortem brain samples from CTRL and AD  subjects, as well as analysis of publicly available mouse and human brain RNA-Seq  datasets. We found that: (1) TSPO is expressed not just in microglia, but also in  astrocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells; (2) there is  substantial overlap of tspo mRNA and TSPO levels between AD and CTRL subjects and in  TSPO levels between temporal neocortex and white matter in both groups; (3) TSPO  cortical burden does not correlate with the burden of activated microglia or  reactive astrocytes, Aβ plaques or neurofibrillary tangles, or the cortical  thickness; (4) the TSPO rs6971 SNP does not significantly impact tspo mRNA or TSPO  levels, the magnitude of glial responses, the cortical thickness, or the burden of  AD neuropathological changes.

While these could be just two frequent unrelated comorbidities  in the elderly, epidemiological research has reinforced the idea that mid-life (age  {\textless}65 years) vascular risk factors increase the risk of late-onset (age ≥ 65 years)  dementia, and specifically AD. By contrast, healthy lifestyle choices such as  leisure activities, physical exercise, and Mediterranean diet are considered  protective against AD. Remarkably, several large population-based longitudinal  epidemiological studies have recently indicated that the incidence and prevalence of  dementia might be decreasing in Western countries. Although it remains unclear  whether these positive trends are attributable to neuropathologically definite AD  versus CVID, based on these epidemiological data it has been estimated that a  sizable proportion of AD cases could be preventable. In this review, we discuss the  current evidence about modifiable risk factors for AD derived from epidemiological,  preclinical, and interventional studies, and analyze the opportunities for  therapeutic and preventative interventions.},

	abstract = {Reactive astrocytes were identified as a component of senile amyloid plaques in the cortex of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients several decades ago. However, their role  in AD pathophysiology has remained elusive ever since, in part owing to the  extrapolation of the literature from primary astrocyte cultures and acute brain  injury models to a chronic neurodegenerative scenario. Recent accumulating evidence  supports the idea that reactive astrocytes in AD acquire neurotoxic properties,  likely due to both a gain of toxic function and a loss of their neurotrophic  effects. However, the diversity and complexity of this glial cell is only beginning  to be unveiled, anticipating that astrocyte reaction might be heterogeneous as well.  Herein we review the evidence from mouse models of AD and human neuropathological  studies and attempt to decipher the main conundrums that astrocytes pose to our  understanding of AD development and progression. We discuss the morphological  features that characterize astrocyte reaction in the AD brain, the consequences of  astrocyte reaction for both astrocyte biology and AD pathological hallmarks, and the  molecular pathways that have been implicated in this reaction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bibliometric and scientometric methods can be applied to the study of a research field. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a bibliometric and scientometric  analysis of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) research field could render trends that  provide researchers and funding agencies valuable insight into the history of the  field, current tendencies, and potential future directions. METHODS: We performed  searches in publicly available databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science,  and Alzheimer's Funding Analyzer for the period 1975-2014, and conducted a curve  fitting analysis with non-linear regression. RESULTS: While the rate and impact of  publications continue to increase, the number of patents per year is currently  declining after peaking in the late 2000s, and the funding budget has plateaued in  the last 5-10 years analyzed. Genetics is the area growing at a fastest pace,  whereas pathophysiology and therapy have not grown further in the last decade. Among  the targets of pathophysiology research, amyloid-β continues to be the focus of  greatest interest, with tau and apolipoprotein E stagnant after a surge in the  1990s. The role of inflammation, microglia, and the synapse are other research  topics with growing interest. Regarding preventative strategies, education  attainment, diet, and exercise are recently gaining some momentum, whereas NSAIDs  and statins have lost the spotlight they once had. CONCLUSION: Our bibliometric and  scientometric analysis provides distinct trends in AD research in the last four  decades, including publication and patent output, funding, impact, and topics. Our  findings could inform the decision-making of research funding agencies in the near  future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological evidence has linked hypoxia with the development of Alzheimer disease (AD). A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have reported  that hypoxia can induce amyloid-β peptide accumulation through various molecular  mechanisms including the up-regulation of the amyloid-β precursor protein, the  β-secretase Bace1, or the γγ-secretase complex components, as well as the  down-regulation of Aβ-degrading enzymes. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of  acute and chronic sustained hypoxia in Aβ generation in vivo. METHODS: 2-3 month-old  C57/Bl6J wild-type mice were exposed to either normoxia (21\% O2) or hypoxia (9\% O2)  for either 4 to 72 h (acute) or 21-30 days (chronic sustained) in a hermetic  chamber. Brain mRNA levels of Aβ-related genes were measured by quantitative  real-time PCR, whereas levels of Bace1 protein, full length AβPP, and its C-terminal  fragments (C99/C88 ratio) were measured by Western blot. In addition, 8 and  14-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice were subjected to 9\% O2 for 21 days and levels  of Aβ40, Aβ42, full length AβPP, and soluble AβPPα (sAβPPα) were measured by ELISA  or WB. RESULTS: Hypoxia (either acute or chronic sustained) did not impact the  transcription of any of the Aβ-related genes in young wild-type mice. A significant  reduction of Bace1 protein level was noted with acute hypoxia for 16 h but did not  correlate with an increased level of full length AβPP or a decreased C99/C83 ratio.  Chronic sustained hypoxia did not significantly alter the levels of Bace1, full  length AβPP or the C99/C83 ratio. Last, chronic sustained hypoxia did not  significantly change the levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, full length AβPP, or sAβPPα in either  young or aged APP/PS1 mice. DISCUSSION: Our results argue against a hypoxia-induced  shift of AβPP proteolysis from the non-amyloidogenic to the amyloidogenic pathways.  We discuss the possible methodological caveats of previous in vivo studies.},

NFTs  and neuritic plaques are well-established contributors to cognitive impairment, but  whether the Thal amyloid stage independently predicts antemortem cognition remains  unknown. We used the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center autopsy data set to  build adjacent-categories logit regression models with CDR-SOB and Mini-Mental State  Examination (MMSE) scores as cognitive outcome variables. Increasing CERAD scores  were independently associated with higher CDR-SOB scores, whereas increasing Braak  NFT stages predicted both higher CDR-SOB and lower MMSE scores. Increasing Thal  amyloid stages were not significantly independently associated with either outcome  measure. Increasing ABC scores predicted higher CDR-SOB and lower MMSE scores. These  results raise the possibility that Thal amyloid stages do not substantially  contribute to predicting antemortem cognition compared to CERAD neuritic plaque  scores and Braak NFT stages, and suggest that the diffuse amyloid deposits  participating in the assignment of Thal amyloid stages are neutral with respect to  clinically detectable cognitive and functional changes.},

	abstract = {Amyloid (senile) plaques, one of the two pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD), are associated with dystrophic neurites and glial responses, both astrocytic  and microglial. Although plaque burden remains relatively stable through the  clinical course of AD, whether these features of local plaque toxicity continue to  worsen over the course of the disease is unclear. We performed an unbiased  plaque-centered quantification of SMI312(+) dystrophic neurites, GFAP(+) reactive  astrocytes, and IBA1(+) and CD68(+) activated microglia in randomly selected  dense-core (Thioflavin-S(+)) plaques from the temporal neocortex of 40 AD subjects  with a symptom duration ranging from 4 to 20 years, and nine nondemented control  subjects with dense-core plaques. Dystrophic neurites (Kendall τ = 0.34, P = 0.001),  reactive astrocytes (Kendall τ = 0.30, P = 0.003), and CD68(+) (Kendall τ = 0.48, P  {\textless} 0.0001), but not IBA1 microglia (Kendall τ = 0.045, P = 0.655), exhibited a  significant positive correlation with symptom duration. When excluding control  subjects, only the positive association between CD68(+) microglia and symptom  duration remained significant (Kendall τ = 0.39, P = 0.0003). The presence of the  APOEε4 allele did not affect these results. We conclude that plaques exert an  increasing toxicity in the surrounding neuropil over the clinical course of AD,  thereby potentially contributing to cognitive decline.},

	abstract = {Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and α-synuclein (α-syn)-rich Lewy bodies are the major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease,  respectively. An overlap of pathologies is found in most individuals with dementia  with Lewy bodies (DLB) and in more than 50\% of AD cases. Their brains display  substantial α-syn accumulation not only in Lewy bodies, but also in dystrophic  neurites decorating Aβ plaques. Several studies report binding and coaggregation of  Aβ and α-syn, yet the precise role of α-syn in amyloid plaque formation remains  elusive. Here we performed intracerebral injections of α-syn-containing preparations  into amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (expressing APP695(KM670/671NL)  and PSEN1(L166P) under the control of the neuron-specific Thy-1 promoter; referred  to here as 'APPPS1'). Unexpectedly, α-syn failed to cross-seed Aβ plaques in vivo,  but rather it inhibited plaque formation in APPPS1 mice coexpressing SNCA(A30P)  (referred to here as 'APPPS1 × [A30P]aSYN' double-transgenic mice). This was  accompanied by increased Aβ levels in cerebrospinal fluid despite unchanged overall  Aβ levels. Notably, the seeding activity of Aβ-containing brain homogenates was  considerably reduced by α-syn, and Aβ deposition was suppressed in grafted tissue  from [A30P]aSYN transgenic mice. Thus, we conclude that an interaction between Aβ  and α-syn leads to inhibition of Aβ deposition and to reduced plaque formation.},

Essential for  this cleavage is the transport and sorting of both proteins through endosomal/Golgi  compartments. Golgi-localized γ-ear-containing ARF-binding (GGA) proteins have  striking cargo-sorting functions in these pathways. Recently, GGA1 and GGA3 were  shown to interact with BACE1, to be expressed in neurons, and to be decreased in AD  brain, whereas little is known about GGA2. Since GGA1 impacts Aβ generation by  confining APP to the Golgi and perinuclear compartments, we tested whether all GGAs  modulate BACE1 and APP transport and processing. We observed decreased levels of  secreted APP alpha (sAPPα), sAPPβ, and Aβ upon GGA overexpression, which could be  reverted by knockdown. GGA-BACE1 co-immunoprecipitation was impaired upon GGA-GAE  but not VHS domain deletion. Autoinhibition of the GGA1-VHS domain was irrelevant  for BACE1 interaction. Our data suggest that all three GGAs affect APP processing  via the GGA-GAE domain.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Alzheimer disease (AD) APOEε4 risk allele associates with an earlier age at onset and increased amyloid-β deposition, whereas the protective APOEε2  allele delays the onset and appears to prevent amyloid-β deposition. Yet the  clinical and pathological effects of APOEε2 remain uncertain because of its relative  rarity. We investigated the effects of APOEε2 and ε4 alleles on AD pathology and  cognition in a large US data set of well-characterized AD patients. METHODS: We  studied individuals from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center autopsy cohort  across the entire clinicopathological continuum of AD. Multivariate models were  built to examine the associations between APOE alleles and AD neuropathological  changes, using the APOEε3/ε3 group as comparator. Mediation analysis was used to  estimate the direct and indirect effects of APOE alleles on AD pathology and  cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes and Mini-Mental State Examination).  RESULTS: Compared to APOEε3/ε3, APOEε2 is independently associated with lower Braak  neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stages and possibly fewer neuritic plaques, but has no  direct effect on cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) severity, whereas APOEε4 is  associated with more neuritic plaques and CAA, but has no independent effect on  Braak NFT stage. Unadjusted analyses showed marked differences among APOE genotypes  with respect to cognitive performance (ε2 {\textgreater} ε3 {\textgreater} ε4). Mediation analysis suggests  that this is largely explained through effects on pathology. INTERPRETATION: Even  when adjusted for age at onset, symptom duration, and other demographic variables,  APOEε2 is associated with milder AD pathology and less severe antemortem cognitive  impairment compared to APOEε3 and ε4 alleles, suggesting a relative neuroprotective  effect of APOEε2 in AD.},

	abstract = {We recommend a new term, "primary age-related tauopathy" (PART), to describe a pathology that is commonly observed in the brains of aged individuals. Many autopsy  studies have reported brains with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are  indistinguishable from those of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in the absence of amyloid  (Aβ) plaques. For these "NFT+/Aβ-" brains, for which formal criteria for AD  neuropathologic changes are not met, the NFTs are mostly restricted to structures in  the medial temporal lobe, basal forebrain, brainstem, and olfactory areas (bulb and  cortex). Symptoms in persons with PART usually range from normal to amnestic  cognitive changes, with only a minority exhibiting profound impairment. Because  cognitive impairment is often mild, existing clinicopathologic designations, such as  "tangle-only dementia" and "tangle-predominant senile dementia", are imprecise and  not appropriate for most subjects. PART is almost universally detectable at autopsy  among elderly individuals, yet this pathological process cannot be specifically  identified pre-mortem at the present time. Improved biomarkers and tau imaging may  enable diagnosis of PART in clinical settings in the future. Indeed, recent studies  have identified a common biomarker profile consisting of temporal lobe atrophy and  tauopathy without evidence of Aβ accumulation. For both researchers and clinicians,  a revised nomenclature will raise awareness of this extremely common pathologic  change while providing a conceptual foundation for future studies. Prior reports  that have elucidated features of the pathologic entity we refer to as PART are  discussed, and working neuropathological diagnostic criteria are proposed.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) propagates with characteristic spatiotemporal patterns which follow brain network connections,  implying trans-synaptic transmission of tauopathy. Since misfolded tau has been  shown to transmit across synapses in AD animal models, we hypothesized that synapses  in AD patients may contain misfolded tau. By immunofluorescence imaging of bipartite  synapses from AD subjects, we detected tau protein in 38.4\% of presynaptic and 50.9\%  of postsynaptic terminals. The pre/post distribution for hyperphosphorylated tau was  26.9\%/30.7\%, and for misfolded tau 18.3\%/19.3\%. In the temporal cortex, microscopic  aggregates of tau, containing ultra-stable oligomers, were estimated to accumulate  within trillions of synapses, outnumbering macroscopic tau aggregates such as  tangles by 10000 fold. Non-demented elderly also showed considerable synaptic tau  hyperphosphorylation and some misfolding, implicating the synapse as one of the  first subcellular compartments affected by tauopathy. Misfolding of tau protein  appeared to occur in situ inside synaptic terminals, without mislocalizing or  mistrafficking. Misfolded tau at synapses may represent early signs of neuronal  degeneration, mediators of synaptotoxicity, and anatomical substrates for  transmitting tauopathy, but its actual role in these processes remain to be  elucidated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Discerning dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common and challenging differential diagnoses at the memory  clinic. Although the neuropsychiatric manifestations have been widely reported as  one of the main key points in the differential diagnosis between these two diseases,  to date no neuropsychiatric questionnaire has been specifically devised for this  purpose. METHODS: We administered the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the  Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease (CUSPAD) to a  memory clinic sample of 80 patients with probable DLB and 85 age- and  severity-matched patients with probable AD. Diagnosis of probable DLB was supported  with a positive dopamine transporter SPECT scan. We examined the usefulness of these  two neuropsychiatric tools designed for AD in the differential diagnosis between DLB  and AD. We also investigated the correlations between psychotic symptoms and  measures of cognitive and functional decline. RESULTS: Auditory hallucinations were  very specific of DLB and were usually preceded by visual hallucinations.  Misinterpretation of real visual stimuli (illusions) was more frequent in DLB.  Delusions were both quantitatively and qualitatively different between DLB and AD:  delusional misidentifications were significantly more characteristic of DLB, while  paranoid delusions did not show specificity for DLB. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric  tools are useful to discriminate DLB from AD. Hallucinations and delusions are not  only more frequent in DLB than in AD but also have distinct qualitative  characteristics and patterns of progression that can help clinicians to make a more  accurate differential diagnosis.},

Demographic and  neuropathologic characteristics were correlated with the Clinical Dementia  Rating-Sum of Boxes in the 835 subjects meeting these criteria. Both neuritic  plaques and neurofibrillary tangles independently predicted Clinical Dementia  Rating-Sum of Boxes. Severe small-vessel disease, severe amyloid angiopathy, and  hippocampal sclerosis were also independently associated with the degree of  cognitive impairment. By contrast, education was a strong independent protective  factor against cognitive deficits. The cause of mild to moderate dementia remained  uncertain in 14\% of the patients. Inverse probability weighting suggests the  generalizability of these results to nonautopsied cohorts. These data indicate that  plaques and tangles independently contribute to cognitive impairment, that  concurrent vascular disease strongly correlates with cognitive dysfunction even in a  sample selected to represent the AD pathologic continuum, and that education further  modifies clinical expression. Thus, multiple concomitant etiologies of brain damage  and premorbid characteristics contribute to the uncertainty of AD clinicopathologic  correlations based only on tangles and plaques.},

Recent in vitro studies suggested a link between elevated Aβ and  mitochondrial dysfunction that might contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. However,  the in vivo evidence for mitochondria dysfunction caused by Aβ is still missing.  Using intravital multiphoton imaging with a range of fluorescent markers, we  systematically surveyed mitochondrial structural and functional changes in AD mouse  models. We observed severe impairments to be limited to the vicinity of Aβ plaques,  which included reduction of both numbers and membrane potential of mitochondria and  the emergence of dystrophic and fragmented mitochondria. Both neuronal soma and  neurites with oxidative stress show severe alterations in mitochondrial membrane  potential in amyloid precursor protein mice. These results provide in vivo evidence  revealing Aβ plaques as focal sources of toxicity that lead to severe structural and  functional abnormalities in mitochondria. These alterations may contribute to  neuronal network dysfunction and warrant further investigation as possible targets  for therapeutic intervention in AD.},

	abstract = {Clinico-pathological correlation studies and positron emission tomography amyloid imaging studies have shown that some individuals can tolerate substantial amounts of  Alzheimer's pathology in their brains without experiencing dementia. Few details are  known about the neuropathological phenotype of these unique cases that might prove  relevant to understanding human resilience to Alzheimer's pathology. We conducted  detailed quantitative histopathological and biochemical assessments on brains from  non-demented individuals before death whose brains were free of substantial  Alzheimer's pathology, non-demented individuals before death but whose post-mortem  examination demonstrated significant amounts of Alzheimer's changes ('mismatches'),  and demented Alzheimer's cases. Quantification of amyloid-β plaque burden,  stereologically-based counts of neurofibrillary tangles, neurons and reactive glia,  and morphological analyses of axons were performed in the multimodal association  cortex lining the superior temporal sulcus. Levels of synaptic integrity markers,  and soluble monomeric and multimeric amyloid-β and tau species were measured. Our  results indicate that some individuals can accumulate equivalent loads of amyloid-β  plaques and tangles to those found in demented Alzheimer's cases without  experiencing dementia. Analyses revealed four main phenotypic differences among  these two groups: (i) mismatches had striking preservation of neuron numbers,  synaptic markers and axonal geometry compared to demented cases; (ii) demented cases  had significantly higher burdens of fibrillar thioflavin-S-positive plaques and of  oligomeric amyloid-β deposits reactive to conformer-specific antibody NAB61 than  mismatches; (iii) strong and selective accumulation of hyperphosphorylated soluble  tau multimers into the synaptic compartment was noted in demented cases compared  with controls but not in mismatches; and (iv) the robust glial activation  accompanying amyloid-β and tau pathologies in demented cases was remarkably reduced  in mismatches. Further biochemical measurements of soluble amyloid-β  species-monomers, dimers and higher molecular weight oligomers-in total brain  homogenates and synaptoneurosomal preparations failed to demonstrate significant  differences between mismatches and demented cases. Together, these data suggest that  amyloid-β plaques and tangles do not inevitably result in neural system derangement  and dementia in all individuals. We identified distinct phenotypic characteristics  in the profile of brain fibrillar and soluble amyloid-β and tau accrual and in the  glial response that discriminated demented and non-demented individuals with high  loads of Alzheimer's pathology. Amyloid-β deposition in the form of fibrillar  plaques and intimately related oligomeric amyloid-β assemblies, hyperphosphorylated  soluble tau species localized in synapses, and glial activation emerged in this  series as likely mediators of neurotoxicity and altered cognition, providing further  insight into factors and pathways potentially involved in human susceptibility or  resilience to Alzheimer's pathological changes.},

Array tomography (AT) overcomes these  problems by embedding autopsy tissue in resin and cutting ribbons of ultrathin  serial sections. Ribbons are imaged with immunofluorescence, allowing  high-throughput imaging of tens of thousands of synapses to assess synapse density  and protein composition. The protocol takes {\textasciitilde}3 d per case, excluding image analysis,  which is done at the end of the study. Parallel processing for transmission electron  microscopy (TEM) using a protocol modified to preserve the structure in human  samples allows complementary ultrastructural studies. Incorporation of AT and TEM  into brain banking is a potent way of phenotyping synapses in well-characterized  clinical cohorts in order to develop clinicopathological correlations at the synapse  level.

We postulate that astrocytes and microglia may differentially respond to fibrillar  amyloid β. Therefore, we quantified the size distribution of dense-core thioflavin-S  (ThioS)-positive plaques in the temporal neocortex of 40 AD patients and the  microglial and astrocyte responses in their vicinity (≤50 μm) and performed  correlations between both measures. As expected, both astrocytes and microglia were  clearly spatially associated with ThioS-positive plaques (p = 0.0001, ≤50 μm vs. {\textgreater}50  μm from their edge), but their relationship to ThioS-positive plaque size differed:  larger ThioS-positive plaques were associated with more surrounding activated  microglia (p = 0.0026), but this effect was not observed with reactive astrocytes.  Microglial response to dense-core plaques seems to be proportional to their size,  which we postulate reflects a chemotactic effect of amyloid β. By contrast,  plaque-associated astrocytic response does not correlate with plaque size and seems  to parallel the behavior of plaque-associated neuritic damage.},

The  minor allele of the CD33 SNP rs3865444, which confers protection against AD, was  associated with reductions in both CD33 expression and insoluble amyloid beta 42  (Aβ42) levels in AD brain. Furthermore, the numbers of CD33-immunoreactive microglia  were positively correlated with insoluble Aβ42 levels and plaque burden in AD brain.  CD33 inhibited uptake and clearance of Aβ42 in microglial cell cultures. Finally,  brain levels of insoluble Aβ42 as well as amyloid plaque burden were markedly  reduced in APP(Swe)/PS1(ΔE9)/CD33(-/-) mice.

We performed double-fluorescence immunohistochemical studies of  astrocytes and microglia, followed by unbiased stereology-based quantitation in  temporal cortex of 40 AD patients and 32 age-matched nondemented subjects. Glial  fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC2) were  used as markers of astrocytic and microglial activation, respectively. Aldehyde  dehydrogenase 1 L1 and glutamine synthetase were used as constitutive astrocytic  markers, and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) as a constitutive  microglial marker. As expected, AD patients had higher numbers of GFAP(+) astrocytes  and MHC2(+) microglia than the nondemented subjects. However, both groups had  similar numbers of total astrocytes and microglia and, in the AD group, these total  numbers remained essentially constant over the clinical course of the disease. The  GFAP immunoreactivity of astrocytes, but not the MHC2 immunoreactivity of microglia,  increased in parallel with the duration of the clinical illness in the AD group.  Cortical atrophy contributed to the perception of increased glia density. We  conclude that a phenotypic change of existing glial cells, rather than a marked  proliferation of glial precursors, accounts for the majority of the glial responses  observed in the AD brain.},

	abstract = {Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, inflammation and synaptic and neuronal loss are some of the major neuropathological  hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While genetic mutations in amyloid precursor  protein and presenilin-1 and -2 (PS1 and PS2) genes cause early-onset familial AD,  the etiology of sporadic AD is not fully understood. Our current study shows that  changes in conformation of endogenous wild-type PS1, similar to those found with  mutant PS1, occur in sporadic AD brain and during normal aging. Using a mouse model  of Alzheimer's disease (Tg2576) that overexpresses the Swedish mutation of amyloid  precursor protein but has normal levels of endogenous wild-type presenilin, we  report that the percentage of PS1 in a pathogenic conformation increases with age.  Importantly, we found that this PS1 conformational shift is associated with amyloid  pathology and precedes amyloid-β deposition in the brain. Furthermore, we found that  oxidative stress, a common stress characteristic of aging and AD, causes pathogenic  PS1 conformational change in neurons in vitro, which is accompanied by increased  Aβ42/40 ratio. The results of this study provide important information about the  timeline of pathogenic changes in PS1 conformation during aging and suggest that  structural changes in PS1/γ-secretase may represent a molecular mechanism by which  oxidative stress triggers amyloid-β accumulation in aging and in sporadic AD brain.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing dementia. Massive deposition of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) as senile plaques in  the brain is the pathological hallmark of AD, but oligomeric, soluble forms of Aβ  have been implicated as the synaptotoxic component. The apolipoprotein E ε 4 (apoE  ε4) allele is known to be a genetic risk factor for developing AD. However, it is  still unknown how apoE impacts the process of Aβ oligomerization. Here, we found  that the level of Aβ oligomers in APOE ε4/ε4 AD patient brains is 2.7 times higher  than those in APOE ε3/ε3 AD patient brains, matched for total plaque burden,  suggesting that apoE4 impacts the metabolism of Aβ oligomers. To test this  hypothesis, we examined the effect of apoE on Aβ oligomer formation. Using both  synthetic Aβ and a split-luciferase method for monitoring Aβ oligomers, we observed  that apoE increased the level of Aβ oligomers in an isoform-dependent manner (E2 {\textless}  E3 {\textless} E4). This effect appears to be dependent on the ApoE C-terminal domain.  Moreover, these results were confirmed using endogenous apoE isolated from the  TBS-soluble fraction of human brain, which increased the formation of Aβ oligomers.  Together, these data show that lipidated apoE, especially apoE4, increases Aβ  oligomers in the brain. Higher levels of Aβ oligomers in the brains of APOE ε4/ε4  carriers compared with APOE ε3/ε3 carriers may increase the loss of dendritic spines  and accelerate memory impairments, leading to earlier cognitive decline in AD.},

	abstract = {In Alzheimer disease (AD), deposition of neurofibrillary tangles and loss of synapses in the neocortex and limbic system each correlate strongly with cognitive  impairment. Tangles are composed of misfolded hyperphosphorylated tau proteins;  however, the link between tau abnormalities and synaptic dysfunction remains  unclear. We examined the location of tau in control and AD cortices using  biochemical and morphologic methods. We found that, in addition to its  well-described axonal localization, normal tau is present at both presynaptic and  postsynaptic terminals in control human brains. In AD, tau becomes  hyperphosphorylated and misfolded at both presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals,  and this abnormally posttranslationally modified tau is enriched in  synaptoneurosomal fractions. Synaptic tau seems to be hyperphosphorylated and  ubiquitinated, and forms stable oligomers resistant to SDS denaturation. The  accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau oligomers at human AD synapses is associated  with increased ubiquitinated substrates and increased proteasome components,  consistent with dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our findings suggest  that synaptic hyperphosphorylated tau oligomers may be an important mediator of the  proteotoxicity that disrupts synapses in AD.},

We  measured the size distribution of total immunoreactive (10D5-positive) and  dense-core (Thioflavin S-positive) plaques in the temporal neocortex of a large  group of subjects with AD and age-matched plaque-bearing subjects without dementia  to test the hypothesis that amyloid plaques continue to grow along with the  progression of the disease. The size of amyloid β (10D5)-positive plaques did not  differ between groups, whereas dense-core plaques from the group with AD were  slightly larger than those from the group without dementia (∼25\%-30\%, p = 0.01).  Within the group with AD, dense-core plaque size did not independently correlate  with duration of clinical disease (from 4 to 21 years, p = 0.68), whereas  10D5-positive plaque size correlated negatively with disease duration (p = 0.01). By  contrast, an earlier age of symptom onset strongly predicted a larger postmortem  plaque size; this effect was independent of disease duration and the presence of the  APOE[Latin Small Letter Open E]4 allele (p = 0.0001). We conclude that plaques vary  in size among patients, with larger size distributions correlating with an earlier  age of onset, but plaques do not substantially increase in size over the clinical  course of the disease.},

Using array tomography, we analysed {\textgreater}50000 synapses in brains of 11  patients with Alzheimer's disease and five non-demented control subjects and found  that synapse loss around senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease correlates with the  burden of oligomeric amyloid-β in the neuropil and that this synaptotoxic  oligomerized peptide is present at a subset of synapses. Further analysis reveals  apolipoprotein E ε4 patients with Alzheimer's disease have significantly higher  oligomeric amyloid-β burden and exacerbated synapse loss around plaques compared  with apolipoprotein E ε3 patients. Apolipoprotein E4 protein colocalizes with  oligomeric amyloid-β and enhances synaptic localization of oligomeric amyloid-β by  {\textgreater}5-fold. Biochemical characterization shows that the amyloid-β enriched at synapses  by apolipoprotein E4 includes sodium dodecyl sulphate-stable dimers and trimers. In  mouse primary neuronal culture, lipidated apolipoprotein E4 enhances oligomeric  amyloid-β association with synapses via a mechanism involving apolipoprotein E  receptors. Together, these data suggest that apolipoprotein E4 is a co-factor that  enhances the toxicity of oligomeric amyloid-β both by increasing its levels and  directing it to synapses, providing a link between apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype and  synapse loss, a major correlate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.},

In  addition, clinicopathological correlation studies have been crucial to generate  hypotheses about the pathophysiology of the disease, by establishing that there is a  continuum between "normal" aging and AD dementia, and that the amyloid plaque  build-up occurs primarily before the onset of cognitive deficits, while  neurofibrillary tangles, neuron loss, and particularly synaptic loss, parallel the  progression of cognitive decline.

We investigated the  progression of reactive glial cells and their relationship with AD pathological  hallmarks to test whether glial cells are linked only to amyloid deposits or also to  tangle deposition, thus integrating both lesions as a marker of disease severity. We  conducted a quantitative stereology-based post-mortem study on the temporal  neocortex of 15 control subjects without dementia and 91 patients with AD, including  measures of amyloid load, neurofibrillary tangles, reactive astrocytes, and  activated microglia. We also addressed the progression of glial responses in the  vicinity (≤50 μm) of dense-core plaques and tangles. Although the amyloid load  reached a plateau early after symptom onset, astrocytosis and microgliosis increased  linearly throughout the disease course. Moreover, glial responses correlated  positively with tangle burden, whereas astrocytosis correlated negatively with  cortical thickness. However, neither correlated with amyloid load. Glial responses  increased linearly around existing plaques and in the vicinity of tangles. These  results indicate that the progression of astrocytosis and microgliosis diverges from  that of amyloid deposition, arguing against a straightforward relationship between  glial cells and plaques. They also suggest that reactive glia might contribute to  the ongoing neurodegeneration.},

An alternative  hypothesis is that soluble oligomers ofAβ play a much larger role in neuronal damage  than the insoluble component. We have tested these competing hypotheses in vivo by  studying the clinicopathologic correlates of oligomeric Aβ species and classic  fibrillar amyloid plaques in the brains of double-transgenic APP-tau mice up to 17  months of age. Biochemical and immunohistochemical measures of brain oligomeric Aβ  exponentially increased with age. Oligomeric Aβ load correlated with morphological  markers of fibrillar Aβ deposition. In contrast to total amyloid plaque burden, the  amount of oligomeric Aβ deposits labeled by the conformational epitope-specific  antibody Nab61 closely correlated with neuronal loss and numbers of astrocytes in  the entorhinal cortex and the CA1 hippocampal subfield. However, like other  morphological Aβ measurements, brain oligomeric Aβ burden did not correlate well  with memory deficits in these mice. The number of glial fibrillary acidic  protein-positive astrocytes in entorhinal cortex and CA1 most tightly correlated  with memory impairment and neuronal cell loss. Based on these findings, we  hypothesize that the astrocyte response, which is likely triggered by brain  oligomeric Aβ accumulation, adversely affects cognition and might also contribute to  neuronal cell death in this model.},

Experimental evidence indicates that some statins can cross  the blood-brain barrier, alter brain cholesterol metabolism, and may ultimately  decrease the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Despite these promising  leads, clinical trials have yielded inconsistent results regarding the benefits of  statin treatment in AD. Seeking to detect a biological signal of statins effect on  AD, we conducted a 12-week open-label trial with simvastatin 40 mg/d and then 80  mg/d in 12 patients with AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment and  hypercholesterolemia. We quantified cholesterol precursors and metabolites and AD  biomarkers of Abeta and tau in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid at baseline and  after the 12-week treatment period. We found a modest but significant inhibition of  brain cholesterol biosynthesis after simvastatin treatment, as indexed by a decrease  of cerebrospinal fluid lathosterol and plasma 24S-hydroxycholesterol. Despite this  effect, there were no changes in AD biomarkers.

	abstract = {Anti-amyloid-beta immunization leads to amyloid clearance in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but the effect of vaccination on amyloid-beta-induced neuronal  pathology has not been quantitatively examined. The objectives of this study were to  address the effects of anti-amyloid-beta active immunization on neurite trajectories  and the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease in the human hippocampus.  Hippocampal sections from five patients with Alzheimer's disease enrolled in the  AN1792 Phase 2a trial were compared with those from 13 non-immunized Braak-stage and  age-matched patients with Alzheimer's disease, and eight age-matched non-demented  controls. Analyses included neurite curvature ratio as a quantitative measure of  neuritic abnormalities, amyloid and tau loads, and a quantitative characterization  of plaque-associated neuritic dystrophy and astrocytosis. Amyloid load and density  of dense-core plaques were decreased in the immunized group compared to  non-immunized patients (P {\textless} 0.01 and P {\textless} 0.001, respectively). The curvature ratio  in non-immunized patients with Alzheimer's disease was elevated compared to  non-demented controls (P {\textless} 0.0001). In immunized patients, however, the curvature  ratio was normalized when compared to non-immunized patients (P {\textless} 0.0001), and not  different from non-demented controls. In the non-immunized patients, neurites close  to dense-core plaques (within 50 microm) were more abnormal than those far from  plaques (i.e. beyond 50 microm) (P {\textless} 0.0001). By contrast, in the immunized group  neurites close to and far from the remaining dense-core plaques did not differ, and  both were straighter compared to the non-immunized patients (P {\textless} 0.0001). Compared  to non-immunized patients, dense-core plaques remaining after immunization had  similar degree of astrocytosis (P = 0.6060), more embedded dystrophic neurites (P {\textless}  0.0001) and were more likely to have mitochondrial accumulation (P {\textless} 0.001). In  addition, there was a significant decrease in the density of paired helical  filament-1-positive neurons in the immunized group as compared to the non-immunized  (P {\textless} 0.05), but not in the density of Alz50 or thioflavin-S positive tangles,  suggesting a modest effect of anti-amyloid-beta immunization on tangle pathology.  Clearance of amyloid plaques upon immunization with AN1792 effectively improves a  morphological measure of neurite abnormality in the hippocampus. This improvement is  not just attributable to the decrease in plaque load, but also occurs within the  halo of the remaining dense-core plaques. However, these remaining plaques still  retain some of their toxic potential. Anti-amyloid-beta immunization might also  ameliorate the hippocampal tau pathology through a decrease in tau phosphorylation.  These data agree with preclinical animal studies and further demonstrate that human  anti-amyloid-beta immunization does not merely clear amyloid from the Alzheimer's  disease brain, but reduces some of the neuronal alterations that characterize  Alzheimer's disease.},
